# Question

What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer

The function `print double` has extra pair of parenthesis when it is being invoked. This is incorrect because we are not passing in any values to `print double`.

To call the function `print double` properly, you can remove the parenthesis and it will run!

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums.forEach(printDouble);
```
