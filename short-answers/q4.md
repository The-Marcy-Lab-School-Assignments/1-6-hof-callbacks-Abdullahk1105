# Question

What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer

An **_inline function_** looks like this :

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
```

Inline fucntions are usually created on the same line, functions like this are often used for short, concise operations where a separate function declaration might be unnecessary, and it makes it easier to read the code.

An inline function is one that is defined, but not initialized or declared, directly in the code where it is needed or within the context of where it is used. It is also called an anonymous function because it is not given a name when defined.

We use them often for callback functions or when we want to immediately execute something. An example would be using an inline function within a method and logging it to the console:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(num)); //1, 2, 3
```
