# Question

What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer

An **_inline function_** looks like this :

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
```

Inline fucntions are usually created on the same line, functions like this are often used for short, concise operations where a separate function declaration might be unnecessary, and it makes it easier to read the code.
